We are excited to announce the European Testing Conference program: [http://europeantestingconference.eu/schedule/](http://europeantestingconference.eu/schedule/)

To celebrate the publication, we have extended our Early Bird price availability until **end of Friday December 4th**. The early bird price is **580 euros for the two-day conference**. Full conference price is 750 euros.

We are hyped about the program we've put together for you, with a mix of different views of testing, and focus on skills you might need to learn and practice. We have four amazing, inspirational keynotes, 15 practical talks and 6 hands-on workshops to help you grow with us as in testing, regardless of the main role you identify with.

While we could not fit everything into the scheduled program, we extended our open space. There’s a *continuous open space* at our expo area in addition to *scheduled open space* on day 2. Open spaces are for every participants questions, topics and sessions.  We know many of our speakers would have been eager to share more than we could schedule, and open space is your chance to introduce topics of your choice.

We hope to see in in Bucharest Feb 11-12th. [Get your ticket now](https://holvi.com/shop/EuroTestingConf/product/307fb905d2067da1cf9c6a68c2e31e33/).
