author: Maaret Pyh채j채rvi

For reasons beoynd our control, one of our speakers is unable to arrive to the conference. *Jyothi Rangaiah* would have loved to be around to share her ideas and experiences on Reusable mindmaps. She unfortunately can't join as a Finnish organizing non-profit has blocks on way of applying for a visa to Romania we could not resolve on time for this year.

The replacement talk is done by Maaret Pyh채j채rvi, and is titled Learning in Layers. The talk is a demonstration of thought processes Maaret has while testing one specific application.

There's still time to join the action, we're selling tickets up until 4 days into the conference to enable the great content for as many of you as possible.

We hope to see in in Bucharest Feb 11-12th. [Get your ticket now](https://holvi.com/shop/EuroTestingConf/product/307fb905d2067da1cf9c6a68c2e31e33/).
