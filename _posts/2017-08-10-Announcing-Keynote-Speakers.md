European Testing Conference 2018 proudly introduces our four keynote speakers:

<b>Lanette Creamer</b> is a hands-on tester, bringing deep testing perspectives into the teams she works with as a test pilot - someone flying between projects. Her deep insights are summarized into a great talk titled **Test like a Cat** where we have a chance of learning ways to approach our projects in smart ways.

<b>Jessica Kerr</b> is a senior programmer bringing perspectives from the programmer angle. She's great at many things, and one to mention is the Greater than Code podcast, where she is one of the regular hosts. She has not yet decided the perspective she will share with us, and we're sure to let you know when that info is available.

<b>Gojko Adjic</b> is known for radical perspectives into how the world of software is changing, and seems a bit of a role chameleon. Being an absolutely inspiring person, he will share on a title **Visual Testing** with a talk of work he is doing right now. Paraphrasing him, it could be a success or failure, but the talk surely is something worth hearing and learning from.

<b>Zeger van Hese</b> is a consultant and insightful speaker. Zeger represents skills one needs to be excellent at testing, regardless of one's role. His talk titled **The Power of Doubt - Becoming a Software Sceptic** is brilliant.

Join us for enjoying their messages and many others in Amsterdam, the Netherlands in February 2018! We're delighted to welcome our keynote speakers and look forward to enjoying learning with them in the conference.
