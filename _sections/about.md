European Testing Conference (ETC) brings together software professionals with different perspectives to testing in a sprit of dialogue and mutual learning. We travel the European locations in a yearly cycle, visiting the lovely city of Bucharest, Romania in February 2012. The conference is 1 day of training workshops (full and half-day) and 2 days of the conference, with 3 keynotes in the conference days.

We seek to share actionable ideas, tools and techniques as talks and workshops both as invited speakers and open space (everyone contributes) setting.

We balance practical lessons of testing as developers are learning to do it (checking, as artifact) and as testers are learning to do it (exploring, as performance). We're equally interested in functional and non-functional aspects of testing.  We have content for newcomers as well as seasoned in all roles of software development: managers, analysts, designers, developers, testers and operations.
