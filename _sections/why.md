**European Testing Conference (ETC)** will see its first realization in February 2016 in the lovely city of Bucharest. It’s emerging from the need of putting practical testing from developer and testing perspectives together and from the ideas of Adi Bolboacă (Developer from Romania) and Maaret Pyhäjärvi (Tester from Finland). 

The conference will:

 - Travel around Europe with a yearly cycle
 - Balance practical lessons of testing as developers are learning to do them (checking, as artifact) and as testers are lea rning to do them (exploring, as performance) 
 - Build on a dialogue culture instead of an argument culture 
 - Focus on sharing actionable ideas, tools and techniques as talks and workshops in invited and open space setting
 - Have content for newcomers as well as seasoned in all roles of software development: managers, analysts, designers, developers, testers and operations.  

The conference will be 1 day of training workshops (full and half-day) and 2 days of the actual conference, with 3 keynotes in the conference days. 

Our mission is to build a practical conference that raises the bar in the testing world by bringing together the often separated perspectives to testing, in a spirit of dialogue and mutual learning. 

In long term, we also seek to raise the bar in how professional conferences are organized as in being fair for the professional speakers. We start with minimum of paying for travel and accommodation, and sharing profits with our speakers. For participants, we hope this means availability to the best possible content, as joining us would not be a financially viable option. 

Organizers core group consists of Adi Bolboacă [adibolb](https://twitter.com/adibolb), Maaret Pyhäjärvi [@maaretp](https://twitter.com/maaretp), Llewellyn Falco [@LlewellynFalco](https://twitter.com/LlewellynFalco), Alina Ionescu [@al_innutza](https://twitter.com/al_innutza) and Aki Salmi [@rinkkasatiainen](https://twitter.com/rinkkasatiainen). 

At this point, we’re looking for people to join us in the organizing in three roles:

 - **Advisory group members**. We seek for geographically dispersed group of people, volunteering to participate a few online discussions about the best possible contents for a conference like this. We will portray you on our website, and keep you updated on our progress, and welcome your help in finding next locations in the upcoming years. This is a great change of building something fun, together. 
 - **On-site volunteers**. We will need people at the event, who volunteer to help us run the show. This role will get you a free entry, but will also keep you busy for some parts of the conference. 
 - **Organizers**. We seek people who want to be in our group of organizers, actively putting an effort in making this conference happen. We meet at least bi-weekly online. In particular, we would love to see people with local presence in Bucharest join the group of organizers.
