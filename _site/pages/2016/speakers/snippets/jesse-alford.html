<p><strong>Jesse Alford</strong> has made a career of listening to good advice. He doesn’t have the sense to know that the idealistic things he’s been told to do (like: pairing, exploration, TDD, BDD, and Continuous Integration) don’t work; he just goes on succeeding with them anyway. He’s an engineer and noted exploratory tester working for Pivotal in San Francisco on Cloud Foundry, the open-source Platform as a Service. He insists his bios include the phrase “he built his own keyboard, like Jedi build their own lightsabers.” His cats are reputed to be adorable.</p>
