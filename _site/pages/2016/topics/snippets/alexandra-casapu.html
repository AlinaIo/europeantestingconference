<p>To facilitate the observation of my testing skills, I’ve worked on a set of guidelines that help me in the reflection process.
In this workshop, you’re welcome to try them out, maybe tweak them to your own reflection style, and share how you examine your own testing skills map.
In the first part we will go through the guidelines and get a common understanding of the concepts used. In the second part of the workshop, you get to practice on it, while faced with a problem-solving situation: discovering the pattern of a wicked blackbox!
We will end the workshop with, of course, a reflection on the whole experience - a debrief and conclusions. We’ll tackle questions like “How can you incorporate reflection in your testing work?”, “What are some ways to become more aware of our testing skills?”, and “How can all this be useful in our work activities?”</p>
