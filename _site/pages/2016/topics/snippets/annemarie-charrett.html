<p>Cross-functional teams are a popular and on-trend approach to
distributing the testing effort across software development. Ebay,
Google, Microsoft are some of the more well-known names to have
adopted this approach. In these companies, a test lead may oversee and
support multiple teams reporting to the head of engineering.</p>

<p>Where does that leave the concept of test management and test manager?
Are these ideas  irrelevant in todays  agile approach to software
development?</p>

<p>At Tyro Payments, we’ve built a team from 5 to 23 testers in one year.
We’ve experimented with test management and the role of test manager.
We’ve constantly evolved our ideas about what it meant to lead testing
in a high growth organisation.</p>

<p>This keynote will describe our growth, how we pivoted based on
experimentation and learning. It will share some insights and traps to
avoid. It will end with ideas about the future of test management and
how it might fit into a future, where the only certainty is that
testing will look very different to what is is today.</p>
