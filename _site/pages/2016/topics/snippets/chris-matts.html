<p>Testers are limited by their role. Testers are only allowed to be testers. We need to break the tester mold and replace it with a new roleâ€¦ the tester.
The tester is a much bigger role than it currently is. Its much bigger, it much more valuable, its higher status and its much more fun. So do you want to be
a tester? Or would you rather be a tester?</p>
