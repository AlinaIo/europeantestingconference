<p><strong>Daniel Billing</strong> enjoys testing in all it’s variety. Recently he has been focusing hard on security and it’s implications for testing and testers. He’ll be running a training on how testers can incorporate security testing techniques and knowledge into their day to day work. But you can talk to him about anything you like! I particularly like Science Fiction, soccer, good food, beer and exercise!</p>

<p>Dan also a facilitator for Weekend Testing Europe, an organiser of SWEWT, and South West Test in Bristol.</p>

<p>Dan teaches a half-day pre-conference training <strong>Web Application Security: A Hands on Testing Challenge</strong> and is available to share on Security Testing throughout the conference lean coffees and open spaces.</p>
