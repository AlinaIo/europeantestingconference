<p><strong>Dragan Spiridonov</strong> is a test lead with a background as a teacher. He currently works at Drytools, a Serbian start-up. With 18 years of IT experience and recent move to the testing, his testing work puts together things he is learning now with things he’s learned in other roles over the years. He’s been a system and network administrator, customer support, developer, trainer and a teacher, and now a tester. His interest in learning and sharing shows in the nickname his friends use on him, as they call him the professor. Dragan contributes in the local community (Test’RS Club) and shares actively at work. He is a father of two princesses, and teaching kids is part of his interests as he delivers “How to code with or without computer” workshops for kids.</p>
