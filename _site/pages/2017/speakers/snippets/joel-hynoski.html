<p><strong>Joel Hynoski</strong> had a lucky break when he was asked to become the Test Manager for a telecommunications company where he was working as a software engineer. It was there that his eyes were opened to the creativity of testing and the incredible increase in developer productivity that could be realized by a strong testing culture and solving problems using engineering rather than brute force hard work. Joel has been working in infrastructure tools and engineering for the past 18 years and manages the Automation, Observability, Release Engineering and Test teams at Lyft. Previously, Joel has experienced and influenced the engineering productivity cultures at companies from startup stage to larger corporations â€“ from Google, Apple (iOS) and Twitter to Pure Networks and Open Telecommunications.</p>
