<p>My name is Vivien and I currently work for House of Test. Some folks call me by my native name: Ronke but I also like to describe myself as a terrific tester! I have coined this from my terrific love for testing and the aggressiveness with which I approach my test task. However I take the definition of terrific that is defined as “awesome” in description of my personality as a tester and that part of being terrifying (fear and awe) towards bugs and anything that degrades the quality of the product. I have a background in Electrical Electronics Engineering. My experience as a tester has been in the mobile industry and Medical technology. I have also studied MBA and MSc. in Electrical Engineering. The blend of MBA with testing profession empowers me with the possibility to leverage my testing skills with some level of business mindedness. I’m quite excited and passionate about testing and for me, testing has been more than a profession, it has been a way of life!</p>
