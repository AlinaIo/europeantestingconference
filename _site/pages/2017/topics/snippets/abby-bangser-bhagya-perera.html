<p>Distributed development is becoming the new normal. The continual improvement on collaboration tools allows for organisations to find the right person for the job as much as employees to find the right career opportunity with a lot less focus on location.</p>

<p>But distribution does not mean just one team style. There are both examples of both successful and struggling teams in many different formats such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Offshore: a single role, typically developer or tester, in a different location from the rest of the team</li>
  <li>Remote: a team thatâ€™s members are able to work from home, this may be everyone or only select members</li>
  <li>Distributed: complete teams with programmers, testers, analysts and others present in each of the global locations</li>
</ul>

<p>Dependencies among delivery team members in different locations usually means that no one location has complete control over product quality. This leads to significant challenges around not only time and cultural differences but also in integration and delivery accountability.</p>

<p>In this workshop, Bhagya and Abby will examine the obstacles faced by both onshore and offshore teams. For example, onshore teams need to negotiate scope and feel the in-person client pressures. Offshore teams have vague requirements they have to piece together, and may be blocked due to lack of access to product owners or business analysts to answer questions.</p>

<p>Through a fast paced hands-on simulation, this workshop will generate ideas for how to improve communication, empathy and in turn productivity and satisfaction.</p>

<p>Key takeaways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Real time evaluation of emotional, physical and mental experiences by both onshore and offshore employees</li>
  <li>Ideas to work around the impediments distributed teams face as they strive to build quality into their product</li>
  <li>Ways to turn disadvantages of distributed teams into positive benefits</li>
</ul>
