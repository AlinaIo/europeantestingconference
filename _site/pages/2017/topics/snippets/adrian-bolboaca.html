<p><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/adibolb/different-types-of-automated-tests">[Slides]</a></p>

<p>This talk is done in collaboration with the audience. There are many types of tests out there. Letâ€™s see the most used types of tests and understand how each one is useful. We will write live code, and we will discuss automated tests written.</p>

<p>The types of tests covered are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Unit Tests = Tests in isolation, focused on methods and classes. White box tests.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Integration Tests = Tests about how two different modules integrate. Black box tests.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Integrated Tests = Big, large tests showing how many modules integrate, with a business purpose. Black box tests.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Acceptance Tests = Tests showing that an application features behaves well. Black box tests.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Contract Tests = Special type of tests, that verify polimorphism integration of multiple components or classes.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We will focus on clean code, good test names that can become <a href="http://mozaicworks.com/blog/executable-specifications">executable specifications</a>.</p>
