<p>Standing by who you are, having the courage to be different, making yourself vulnerable, speaking up when there is something important to you, sharing your fears and joys requires courage.</p>

<p>Courage is individual and there is no such thing as a little courage.</p>

<p>Being brave is not about removing fear or not being afraid â€“ it is about doing what is necessary even when you are afraid.</p>

<p>I live this personally; I have to be brave (even have a tattoo with it).  I will never go back. And it is a big learning I try to pass on to the people, I coach. I will talk about why I have to be brave and vulnerable, give examples of how I am courageous, and why being brave is a big part of my work life.</p>
