<p>Of course you can throw lots of time and effort into doing testing of your app and infrastructure, but is it the right way to approach it? The science of the way we think and apply our knowledge to tasks shows that by approaching testing using your brainpower rather than willpower can result in better quality overall.</p>

<p>We’ve built Lyft’s testing culture from manual beginnings into an automated system using these principles of working from brainpower. Along with our core company values, automating intelligently and breaking the barriers between Test and Development have been important steps along our journey. You’ll learn how we’ve done things so far, what’s next, and how we’re keeping ourselves honest.</p>
