<p>When faced with a challenge, often there are things that hold us back. They slow us down or they keep us from trying at all. And more often than we would like (or think), we ourselves are what is holding us back. We imagine problems where there are none, and by doing so create an actual problem for ourselves. We limit ourselves, because… why actually?</p>

<p>In this talk I will share two stories. One is about my first attempt at test automation; the other one about how my understanding of agile has changed. And through these stories I will share what I’ve learned about self-imposed limitations and about overcoming them.</p>
