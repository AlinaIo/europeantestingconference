**Alexandra Casapu** does software testing at Altom. The environment she works in has facilitated her learning on the importance of context in testing, the exploratory approach, and caring a great deal about improving her testing skills. Her focus on her current project is on achieving a balance between working on understanding the users and their needs and collaborating effectively with the technical team. After finishing school in the educational system, she took full responsibility of her learning. Since then she enrolled in BBST courses, followed courses on Coursera, read challenging books, had coaching sessions on testing, presented at various conferences. In 2013 her presentation was voted for the do-over session at EuroSTAR. She was in the program committee for Eurostar 2014.
