Chris is a programme manager/project manager/business analyst who specialises in delivering trading and risk management systems in investment banks. He was involved in BDD in the early days. Dan North and Chris developed the “GIVEN-WHEN-THEN” template together. Since then he has been working on Feature Injection. Whilst BDD provides a neat interface between the business and the development team, Feature Injection helps the business prepare a comprehensive set of examples to feed the BDD machine. Whilst looking to price the option that exist naturally in an Agile development process Chris tripped over Real Options.
