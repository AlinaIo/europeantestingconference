**Emma Keaveny** is an enthusiastic tester. She delivered her first conference talk at TinyTestBash, and it was so great we invited her to share it with us for a wider audience. Emma works for Interica on archive and retrieval software. This can prove challenging at times having to learn and navigate around various operating systems and databases.  It is an ideal place to learn and hone in on new testing skills and tools that she has picked up and is enjoying every minute of it.  She is also co-organiser of BrighTest Actually, a Brighton based testing meetup where fellow testers get together either for a few drinks, games or some interesting talks.  Wherever Emma can get involved in testing you will see her there, always looking to improve her skill set, learning new techniques and trying them out.
