We all perform experiments
We all explore to some degree
We all test to some degree
The intent of our experiments depends on when its performed and the purpose of the test
We want to focus on testing/experimentation as a skilled activity that benefits us all
Testers need to be experts in experimentation theory and implementation
Testers can be the guides and coaches to experimentation
