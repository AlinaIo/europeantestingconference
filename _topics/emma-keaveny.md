Have you ever found yourself downloading a tool bar you didnâ€™t want?  How about suddenly receiving emails because you accidentally signed up for a mailing list? Possibly the worst yet, sent out invites to an application at your own expense? Well if you have, then you have been whacked with a Dark Pattern!  These patterns are designed to fool you, into applying or buying things you had no intention of getting. In this presentation I will be going through the different types of dark patterns that are out there, how we should approach these as testers (is there a right way or a wrong way to deal with them), as well as covering some pros and cons on these controversial barely legal techniques that are used more frequently than you would think.
