At Pivotal, we strive to organize into balanced teams, with roles that feature overlapping areas of competence and concern. Testing - in many forms - is an essential part of how we support people in extending their attention beyond the traditional boundaries associated with their roles. Exploration helps people to grow into knowing and caring about aspects of the product far afield from the central authority of their role.

Testing is so important, in fact, that it is generally not sequestered into its own role; we trade off having a role with testing authority to make testing a core responsibility of all roles. This talk will discuss the use of exploratory testing practices, and their value and limitations, in the context of Pivotalâ€™s Extreme Programming based approach to balanced product teams.
