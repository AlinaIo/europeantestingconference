**Creating and using reusable mindmaps**

Mindmaps are a great way to visualize what you know through learning, need to remember for later and to share that knowledge further. As such, they have become a favored tool to support testing. When learning for testing of a new perspective or feature, it makes sense to collect ideas in a format that allows restructuring them when you learn more. Personal mindmaps support your own thinking right now, reusable mindmaps are made to share knowledge with a wider audience over long period of time. Reusable mindmaps provide two types of value: the deep learning for their creator, and the shortcut to the topic for those reusing the mindmaps later.

In this talk, Jyothi shares her lessons as creator and user of reusable mindmaps and leads us into learning through her experiences. She is a major contributor for the Test Insane mindmaps repository, having created and shared 19 reusable mindmaps. You will learn from her insights into becoming a better tester structuring your knowledge in this format, and get ideas from how even she uses these mindmaps both created by her and others to aid her testing efforts. We go through samples of different types of mindmaps with insights: ones that document test ideas for a particular common feature (e.g. search); ones that share knowledge of a specialized field of testing (e.g. mobile testing); ones that support quick learning of specific technologies (e.g. web).

Behind every online initiative there’s people doing the work to deliver the results to us. The end product may appear finished, but there’s been a lot of work put into making things appear simple and clear. Join me to learn from this work. Reuse of what has already been created lets you shortcut your learning into various areas of testing. But what you really want to take home from this session is Jyothi’s experience that enables you to create specific reusable mindmaps for your own organization.
