Good testers can do amazing things with your code.
Great testers cheat.

Let's explore how to change code to make it very easy to test. Let's show how to cheat and how to realize when we should be cheating.

We are going to look at lot's of examples of tests to get a design sense of when you should be cheating, then go into 1 or 2 examples of how to make those cheats a reality.
