Pair testing is a way of testing where two people work together on a test assignment. As a pair, you can be more valuable than as a single person. You are each others backup, progress will not stop if one person canâ€™t participate. Working as a pair will also increase the speed of your test work. One person is executing the tests while, at the same time, the other person is making notes. At any time you can switch roles.

To work successfully as a pair, some arrangements need to be agreed upon. In my talk, I will share my own experiences about what is needed to set up pair testing, how to produce value as a pair, and how to explain the benefits of pair testing to your stakeholders. I will demonstrate how testing as a pair can (and will) improve the quality of your work.

With this talk I give the audience information how to convince their team lead that pair testing can and will improve the quality of the test work. This information contains
  * How to set up pair testing
  * Producing value as a pair
  * Explaining the benefits of pairing to your team and management
