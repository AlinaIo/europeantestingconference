**European Testing Conference (ETC)**  mission is to build a practical conference that raises the bar in the testing world.

For our participants, we bring together testing from developer and tester perspectives in a practice-oriented package in a dialog culture, aiming for mutual learning of how testing can be done in practice.

For our speakers, we work against the trend of having to pay for speaking. We start with paying expenses of travel and accommodation. Depending on the success of the conference, we will also be paying a leveled honorarium. Eventually, we seek to pay for speaking and believe it attracts the best speakers to speak with us.

The conference is brought to you from the starting ideas of Adi Bolboacă (Developer from Romania) and Maaret Pyhäjärvi (Tester from Finland). We welcome the software community to contribute in organizing a people-oriented hands-on conference.
