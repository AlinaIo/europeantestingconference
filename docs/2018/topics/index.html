<div class="b-topic__info">


<!--<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/Kevlin/the-error-of-our-ways">[Slides]</a>-->

<p>When visuals come under test automation, the outcome rarely justifies
the cost. Visual tests tend to be too brittle, to difficult to
maintain, and too slow to execute for quick iterative delivery cycles.
However, recent improvements in cloud computing and browser
capabilities make it possible to change the economics of the test
automation pyramid. Gojko will talk propose a new view, looking at how
trends such as approval testing, cloud functions and automated image
analysis can help us automate acceptance/regression tests for visual
look and feel in a visual language, rather than xUnit style code, and
make such tests easy to write, understand, execute and maintain.</p>

<!--<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/Kevlin/the-error-of-our-ways">[Slides]</a>-->

<p>Since the days before recorded history, dogs have been man’s best friend. Dogs obey the pack rules based on an established hierarchy, providing stability for the greater good. With their positivity and teamwork ability, dogs demonstrate traits that are admirable in a friend, colleague or employee. As an industry, software testers have dog traits well ingrained in our culture. It is time to move beyond, and while keeping the good traits we can learn from dogs, incorporate more tricks from cats.</p>

<p>Cats have a different history, being revered as Gods in ancient Egypt. They have yet to forget it. Cats will be fine with or without our approval or intervention, giving them a distinct survival advantage. Cats are charming with an alluring purr that contributes to healing as well as soothing the stress of their human companions. Feline traits like patience and seeing in the dark are a huge advantage when lacking vital information. Cats come equipped with whiskers (an excellent adaptable tool of self-awareness) that help them determine in advance what routes are possible, and which to rule out. Like cats, modern testers may share separate territory, be a part of a larger testing group, or be a lone feral tester in the wilds of an Agile project. Testers may have abundant requirements and ability to question developers, or they may have absolutely nothing. If they test like a cat they will survive either way.</p>

<p>Saying software testing is dead is dead. The dog days of testing are over. Don’t work like a dog. Test like a cat!</p>

<div class="b-topic__info">


<!--<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/Kevlin/the-error-of-our-ways">[Slides]</a>-->

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>These might just be the hardest words to say in any language. We avoid saying them, scared of coming across as doubtful and uncertain. Colleagues expect us to be firm and certain, providing clear answers. Over the past years, I grew increasingly uncomfortable with that. I ended up having a hard time being sure of anything.</p>

<p>“You’re rejecting certainty”, someone said. “That’s skepticism. You’re a tester, embrace it!”</p>

<p>That sounded like a good idea, but this left me with a new challenge: how does one embrace skepticism, and how can this help me improve my testing?</p>

<p>I wanted to get to the bottom of this and, for a year, decided to submerge myself in all things skeptic in hope of finding clues to help me with my testing. It was a fascinating journey that led me from philosophy, critical thinking and science to pseudo-science and the paranormal.</p>

<p>This is the story of how I embraced skepticism and how this influenced my testing: by adopting a skeptic manifesto and creating a portfolio of critical thinking heuristics that can be a valuable addition to any tester’s toolbox. You will leave armed with tips not only on how to muster up the courage to admit not knowing things, but also on improving your questioning skills and reflexes to reject certainty, empowered by the biggest skeptical force of all: knowing that we’re easy to fool.</p>

<p>“Copy… paste… modify one line… done!”</p>

<p>Writing system-level automation can be quite complex - and for some odd reason, many testers have their first work-related coding in this area. Luckily, the internet is here to help. There are many good advice on everything we might need -There are (open source) tools that cover the upper layers: Frameworks that support BDD or KDT, enable easy maintenance of multiple test suites and re-running failed tests. There are awesome tools that cover the lower layers that enable driving browsers or mobile devices, send REST or SOAP requests and generally do whatever we might want to do. 
So how come our test-code is so difficult to maintain? Why doesn’t it look as pretty as the examples we find online?</p>

<p>The reason for that is that the advice we find are missing one part - the part where no generic tool can really help you: Organizing the business actions in a way that is easy to both maintain and use.</p>

<p>In this talk we’ll go over three ways of organizing your automation middle layer  - from a quick gain for the short term that you probably already use, to something a bit more elaborate that your future selves may not hate.</p>

<div class="b-topic__info">


<!--<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/Kevlin/the-error-of-our-ways">[Slides]</a>-->

<p>Microservices is a way to organize your system that provides both opportunities and difficulties for testing. I recently worked with a company transitioning away from a monolithic architecture, and helped them to re-design their automated testing strategy for the new architecture. In this talk I’d like to share some concrete automated testing techniques that I found useful, including selective deployment, approval testing, and event monitoring. I’ll also relate some challenges we encountered enabling the teams developing the various services be able to test and deploy independently of one another.</p>
