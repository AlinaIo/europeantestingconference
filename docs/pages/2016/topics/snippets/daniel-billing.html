<p>Security is a keyword of the day. You’re equally responsible for software security as any of your peers, be they developers, engineers, project and product managers - or testers. You might now something on security, and in this session, you get a feel of trying out some security testing in a mob format.</p>

<p>In this session, we take a vulnerable application and our instructors guide you to work on it together as a team, practicing techniques and working on actionable learning. In the end of the session, you can say that you have the experience of having worked through at least one security flaw with (thinking and software) tools that you could apply at your work. We will explore the clues that your applications can give you about it’s security status, and how we can communicate these issues to our stakeholders effectively.</p>

<p>Daniel Billing is your security expert with the security problem, and can show you what to do in detail. Maaret Pyhäjärvi facilitates the mob testing format: we all work taking turns on one computer, in a manner where all instructions come from people not on the computer.</p>
