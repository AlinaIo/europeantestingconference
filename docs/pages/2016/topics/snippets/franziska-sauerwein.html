<p>TDD (Test Driven Development) has become a widespread practice and CV buzzword in the development community.</p>

<p>When I started getting involved in the European Software Craftsmanship Community, I thought I knew what it was - I was surprised to learn there are many variations of it, and two main schools: the classic approach and the London school. Three years later, and I have been using the outside-in approach successfully in multiple projects and combining it with the classic approach.</p>

<p>This talk will give you an introduction with code examples using Java, Mockito and JUnit, illustrating the basic principles and when to choose it over other styles of TDD.</p>

<p>I will tell from my experiences on how to choose and combine an appropriate TDD approach for typical situations when developing business software.</p>
