<p>“All the brilliant people, working on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, and at the same computer.“ - that is Mob Programming. When the activity we mob on is exploratory testing or test automation, or the viewpoint to being a programming mob is that of a tester, we call it Mob Testing. Mob testing - a group testing activity utilizing one computer - voices out the tacit knowledge in the group of individuals on shared tasks. Facilitated by an expert, it makes a great mechanism for building habits and transferring skills over passing knowledge.</p>

<p>In this course, we amp up our testing skills by learning from one another, and learn in a mob, getting the best knowledge out of the team into the task at hand. With mob testing, we get a glimpse into the head of the testers while they test because “for an idea to go from your head to the computer, it must go through someone else’s hands”. This is a specific communication style called Strong-style pairing, and it connects the group of brilliant minds in the mob in a shared experience.</p>

<p>We will work on different types of activities as a group: from analyzing a user interface to analyzing an individual feature; from having ready code to creating some with test-driven development; and from focusing on testing to focusing on teamwork dynamics.</p>

<p><strong>The training day shows you</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>How mobbing gets the tacit knowledge out in a team in an actionable format</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How to introduce learning in mobbing format at your place of work</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What would it look like to think like an exploratory tester, with intent of understanding coverage while uncovering useful information</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What would it look like to apply testing skills while joining a group programming activity</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How you can improve your collaboration skills in hands-on work</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Note: Course is a hands-on course, but you do not need your own laptop.</em></p>
