**Daniel Billing** has been a tester for 14 years, working within a diverse range of development organizations, mostly in the south west of England. He lives in Frome, Somerset and currently works as a test engineer at New Voice Media, where most of his time is spent working on the security testing needs of the business. This includes mentoring, supporting and training members of the team to use these skills also. Dan is a community builder with local meetups in the Bristol and Bath area, and a co-facilitator for the Weekend Testing Europe chapter. He's shared his lessons on security testing in various conferences, and now joins us to teach security testing in a workshop.
