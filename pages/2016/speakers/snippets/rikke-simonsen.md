computer science and has throughout the years filled the roles of both a web developer, technical tester and business analyst, giving her
a good understanding of the various roles in an agile team. She’s passionate about agile testing and BDD and is the organizer of the “Copenhagen BDD Meetup”.

In her spare time she supports families affected by autism. Having 3 children with autism herself, a disorder that affects the ability to communicate
