Creativity is usually characterised by the ability to perceive things in new ways, finding hidden patterns, and making connections between seemingly unrelated phenomena.

It is sometimes thought that only certain people can be creative, and in order to be creative you need a special talent. This is far from the truth; everyone expresses creativity in their own unique way.

I love to express creativity though drawing and illustrations. Drawing has, in fact, enabled me to become a better tester and communicator, and as a result I have used this skill to learn the importance of collaboration and conversations within my development teams.

In this talk I will share with you my story of the how I have used drawing as a crucial element of software testing, particularly where discovery and collaboration are the ultimate outcome for ‘building the right thing’. I will also share how I have succeeded in enabling my own growth as a coach and facilitator and opened the doors to the next step in my career.

Creativity stems creativity - how will you unleash your creative side?
