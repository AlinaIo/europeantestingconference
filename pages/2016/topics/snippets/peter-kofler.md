title: Creating Clean, Readable and Expressive Executable Specifications

In this workshop we will create executable specifications (aka tests) for a small piece of code. We will work together and experiment with different styles of test case definitions. Although the (FitNesse) specifications are not code, we will focus on their clean structure, e.g. avoiding duplication or hiding irrelevant details. We could create the perfect (technical) specification, which tells nothing about what is being checked. So we will further focus on the readability of our tests, e.g. by choosing names and changing fixture signatures to allow for different representations. In the end our specifications must be human-readable and highly expressive, even for non technical business people.

In this hands-on session we will work with FitNesse. A working knowledge of creating specifications in FitNesse is required. You will also need a laptop with Java installed. A the start of the workshop I will provide you with a fully working instance of FitNesse together with prepared bindings (aka fixtures) to get you started.
