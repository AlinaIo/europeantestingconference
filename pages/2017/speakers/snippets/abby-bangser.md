**Abby Bangser** is a Quality Analyst and has worked on projects in the US, Kenya, India, and the UK. In addition to a diversity of countries, Abby has also had the opportunity to work in a variety of domains and team structures while at Consultant with ThoughtWorks. While the technical challenges of each domain and tech stack have been interesting, she has realised that team practices and team ownership have a much deeper impact on the end deliverable. In addition to client engagements, Abby is heavily involved in the internal QA community, new hire mentoring program, and local communities meetups in London. Outside of work, Abby is an avid athlete and adventurer through rock climbing, SCUBA diving, lacrosse, and now adding tag rugby to the list while in London!
