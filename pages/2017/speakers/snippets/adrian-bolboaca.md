I try to be a continuous learner and a continuous teacher, because I think good software comes from the skills of the people that are involved in the process, on each and every level. Whenever I write code I focus on reducing domain complexity to obtain maintainable software. I love to develop software that helps companies to improve their business, to implement solutions that improve their internal processes and to motivate teams to use their capabilities to yet another level.
