**Daniel Billing** enjoys testing in all it's variety. Recently he has been focusing hard on security and it's implications for testing and testers. He'll be running a training on how testers can incorporate security testing techniques and knowledge into their day to day work. But you can talk to him about anything you like! I particularly like Science Fiction, soccer, good food, beer and exercise!

Dan also a facilitator for Weekend Testing Europe, an organiser of SWEWT, and South West Test in Bristol.
