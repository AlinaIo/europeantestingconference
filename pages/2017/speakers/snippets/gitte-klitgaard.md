**Gitte Klitgaard** is an agile coach, hugger, friend, and much more. She lives and love agile. She took the oath of non-allegiance. Why fight over methods when we can use the energy to help people?

Her preferred tools are listening, intuition, and caring.

Gitte wants to change the world by helping people make the right product, doing it right and very important: have fun doing it.

Gitte is an active part of the agile community and is in the organiser team of both the German Agile Coach Camp and Play4Agile. She believes that the one essential thing of agile is “Inspect and Adapt”. You can say that her heart is in retrospectives.

She has a great interest in how people function, how the brain works, what motivates us, how we can feel better about our selves, how to be perfect in all our imperfections.
She is a geek and passionate about a lot :)

Gitte's sessions are a co-trained pre-conference training **Effective Communication** and a conference keynote.
