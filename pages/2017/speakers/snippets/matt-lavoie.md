**Matt Lavoie** loves solving real problems for real people, and inspiring others to do the same. Though his career began in software development, it pivoted to user experience design after he discovered the field and saw a need for the role. He is now a Sr. User Experience Designer at PowerDMS, a cloud based crucial content platform, and founder of the Downtown UX Meetup, a community of UX professionals and advocates in Orlando, Florida.
