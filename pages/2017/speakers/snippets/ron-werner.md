As a C64 and Amiga veteran, Ron heard the calling of the Internet and got into programming websites in early 2000. Ever since graduating from University he's worked in various technical IT positions. Thoroughly enjoying testing, Ron fully concentrated on software quality in 2008. He successfully built up browser and app automation suites as well as test teams in Germany and the UK while working for a leading international web and mobile software provider for the construction industry. Ron has vast experience in crowdtesting and now specializes in mobile testing. He's currently Mobile Team Lead for QualityMinds, a Software Quality Consultancy in Munich and has been engaged in mobile and web projects. As life's not all about work, he likes mountain biking and climbing as well as spending time with his wife and three sons.
