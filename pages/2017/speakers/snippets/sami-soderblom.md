Sami is one of Finland's leading experts in context-driven quality practices. He has over twelve years of history from a variety of testing and quality leadership positions in nearly twenty different business domains. He's a colorful blogger, award winning author of industry publications and a co-founder of Software Testing Finland, a local context-driven testing community. He regularly shares experiences from his domain of expertise in domestic and international events. Currently he works as a head of testing at TeliaSonera and as a consultant via his company Happy Monkey.

The same white-hot passion Sami feels towards his wife Malin and baby girl Vilja. Whatever time is left from work and family life he spends stumbling in jujutsu, throwing a round of disc golf, enjoying a nice glass of whisky and being afraid of what might attract his passion next. :)
