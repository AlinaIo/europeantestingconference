This talk is done in collaboration with the audience. There are many types of tests out there. Let's see the most used types of tests and understand how each one is useful. We will write live code, and we will discuss automated tests written.


The types of tests covered are:

* Unit Tests = Tests in isolation, focused on methods and classes. White box tests.

* Integration Tests = Tests about how two different modules integrate. Black box tests.

* Integrated Tests = Big, large tests showing how many modules integrate, with a business purpose. Black box tests.

* Acceptance Tests = Tests showing that an application features behaves well. Black box tests.

* Contract Tests = Special type of tests, that verify polimorphism integration of multiple components or classes.


We will focus on clean code, good test names that can become [executable specifications](http://mozaicworks.com/blog/executable-specifications).
