Test automation projects can have a bad tendency to go awry, most especially when higher-level automation (e.g. via the UI) is involved. At some point, automated tests just become too hard to understand, extend and maintain.

This doesn’t have to be the case though. In software development, there are systematic methods and patterns for addressing recurring challenges – and similar approaches also exist for test automation.

In this talk, I’ll present a structured, systematic and tool-independent approach for automating UI tests. The approach and the patterns that result from it haven’t simply been invented from scratch, rather they build on and expand patterns and methodologies well-known from software development and web-testing for example.

During the talk, I’ll briefly explain what patterns are and why they are useful, and I’ll show examples to illustrate the structures I describe. Anyone involved in automating tests (whether they are programmers or not) can profit from learning and applying these patterns in their teams.
