While most teams appreciate the benefits of automation, it is commonly viewed as too time-consuming to be considered as part of an agile sprint - resulting in automation being done in isolation and typically months after the story has been closed. This can lead to several problems including automation team members being disengaged and missing key aspects of the requirements, as well as teams going through a period where new features are being introduced but no regression testing is occurring.

In this interactive workshop, you’ll learn agile-friendly approaches to test automation that will enable you to work smarter - not harder - to close your sprints with automation in place. You’ll apply these techniques to an example sprint story, learn how to collaborate with other stakeholders to ensure automation interests are considered, and will leave empowered to demonstrate to your teams how it is possible to accomplish in-sprint automation.
