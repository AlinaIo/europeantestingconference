The JavaScript ecosystem has come a long way. Over the past couple of years, the toolchain of most JS developers has been improved (and completely replaced) several times. The community is known for producing small, focused, single-purpose tools and libraries, but the high speed and lack of standards pushes the burden of choice onto developers starting new projects or looking to improve their legacy codebases. In this session we're going to have a look at the puzzle pieces that you can use to build the best setup for your team and project. We'll cover tooling such as module bundlers, static analysis tools, type-checking and transpiling modern JS code for legacy environments; and talk about how good programming practices like dependency injection and immutability allow us to write better tests and enable advanced debugging of our applications.
