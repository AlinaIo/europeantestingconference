**Purpose of the workshop:**
Creating a safe space to try out communication techniques
Give the time and opportunity to practice

**Audience:**
Anyone, who has an interest in better communication

**Learning goals:**
How to listen to people so they feel genuinely understood
How to give and receive feedback

**Description:**
People in the software industry are trained in programming, testing, design, documentation, and requirement management. That makes our work very much based on blacks and whites: does it compile? Will the test pass? Does it fulfill the requirements? Bits and bytes, 0s and 1s, verified or not - all black and white.

Communication, on the other hand, is everything in between.
We are not trained to be effective in our communication and yet much of our work requires collaboration with others.

In this workshop we want to give you a space where you can learn effective communication techniques, and have the time to practice these.
Here you will learn to listen, not to respond, but to hear what is actually being said. We will provide you with tools to give and receive feedback. We will help you express what you want and what you need.

We want to inspire you to have the courage to be yourself as you communicate in an effective manner.

**Hosts:**
Aki Salmi & Gitte Klitgaard. Both are quite active in the software community, speaking at and organising (un)conferences. Their focus is on software craftsmanship and agile respectively, and they have a common interest in the people aspects: communication, listening and creating a safe space for people to be themselves.
They believe in and help teams to find joy and purpose at work.
