Standing by who you are, having the courage to be different, making yourself vulnerable, speaking up when there is something important to you, sharing your fears and joys requires courage.

Courage is individual and there is no such thing as a little courage.

Being brave is not about removing fear or not being afraid â€“ it is about doing what is necessary even when you are afraid.

I live this personally; I have to be brave (even have a tattoo with it).  I will never go back. And it is a big learning I try to pass on to the people, I coach. I will talk about why I have to be brave and vulnerable, give examples of how I am courageous, and why being brave is a big part of my work life.
