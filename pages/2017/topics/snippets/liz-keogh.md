Our human ability to spot patterns and apply them underlies our ability to learn... but that same tendency can cause us to see patterns which aren't there, especially when faced with uncertainty. Our natural bias causes us to believe that we understand causes and can make predictions, even in situations where that cannot possibly be true!

When root-cause analysis is flawed, and outcomes only emerge with hindsight, what can we do to help us gather more information about our problems and possible solutions? How can we avoid the trap of our own biases? And what can we do to make sure that our efforts are safe-to-fail?
