Throughout my career I've been involved in projects where the tunnel vision of team members may create product of apparently great quality but may entirely miss their spot in the market or the problem being solved. A source of frustration for me has been trying to get team-mates to look outside of the project bubble and I am now having success doing this through the medium of games and challenges. My next move is to start publicising and teaching methods that I use to help my own testing work - for instance, improving exploratory testing charters by taking inspiration from a method that David Bowie used for creating his song lyrics.
