Mobile Testing specialist Ron is tired of conferences full of sales pitches and wants to make a difference, sharing the love for his craft.
He found a partner in mind with the European Testing Conference and packed the story of a mobile automation journey into a medieval tale with dragons, knights, and, of course, a princess to be rescued!

The story of the knight Sir Rawnell is about to unfold, an unsung hero who rode out to fight the dragon and save the princess. For his quest, given to him by a global leader in construction management software, he had to chose the right weapon. His account will tell you how he found Calabash to automate the end-to-end tests for an iOS & Android hybrid app. The final selection was a difficult one, as you will be told, but he was happy with his choice. Alas, fierce difficulties and hardship are looming! Did he succeed in his quest? Check in to this session to find out…

In the second half Ron will „walk the talk“ and present a live demo of Calabash and Cucumber. He will demonstrate on a hybrid app how you can get started creating your own tests. He will share the joys of the interactive Ruby console - prepare to see the beauty of identifying native and web elements inside hybrid apps, and how to use the console to query your app and help you debug your tests. But no fear, thanks to Cucumber the tests are written as BDD (Given-When-Then), making it easy for all to follow his actions. He will show how you, becoming or being a keen automation engineer, can follow his trails and start your own mobile automation project with Calabash.
