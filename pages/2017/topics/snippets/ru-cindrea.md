While working on different mobile testing projects at Altom, we noticed that while developing our automation for each project we kept running into the same problems and challenges and kept solving them over and over again in each case. So we decided to build AltRunner, an automation framework for mobile apps that uses Appium and offers the support we need to focus on developing good automated checks without being distracted by having to worry about device infrastructure, reporting or execution. In this demo session, I'll show the type of challenges that we encountered over and over throughout the years and the solutions we have found for them as part of AltRunner.
