According to Wikipedia, in the early 1990s ad hoc testing was too often synonymous with sloppy and careless work. As a result a group of context-driven methodologists began using the term "exploratory" seeking to emphasize the dominant thought process involved in unscripted testing, and to begin to develop the practice into a teachable discipline. The world hasn’t been the same since.

All kinds of variations of Exploratory Testing (ET) has been seen in vast variety of contexts over the years. For many it is the most useful approach on testing, while others think it is still something sloppy and careless. In this clinic we’ll get to the bottom of ET under the tutelage of a tester who has spent over 13 years studying and practicing it in almost 20 different business domains, and with team sizes up to 40 people. By testing actual products we’ll take on useful approaches that will help you to bring unforeseen transparency and efficiency in your everyday testing battles.
