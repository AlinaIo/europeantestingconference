Quite a lot of testers miss out on the required mindset for testing. Sometimes it seems that quality consciousness is missing. Little wonder why some testers only find obvious bugs and why quality is far-fetched from the device under test (DUT) despite the presence of testers on the project.

In this presentation I hope to present to you a set of tools that has helped me during my personal journey as a tester. These tools have helped me grow in my reasoning about the challenges I’m faced with on my daily task. My way of reasoning evolved into a set of tools that I refer to as “Mindset Tools”.
While I reflected on my daily task and how to keep growing, I discovered that different task, required different lenses viewed at different angles with different mindsets hence to effectively test I need to tweak my mindset for different task. To achieve this, I need to keep my mindset flexible when I test. To keep my mindset flexible and help me look at things from different angles, I try to put a label on the mindset approaches that I find useful and I call it “Mindset Toolkit”

I will talk about how my *Mindset Toolkit* has helped me grow from a tester that finds obvious bugs to a tester that finds important bugs. I will give examples of different mindset tools and how I have used them to become a better tester. I will also teach the audience how to build their own mindset toolkit.

A few of these Mindset Tools are: User Mindset Tool, “Already Tested” Mindset Tool, Confidence Mindset Tool, Trust Mindset Tool, Courage Mindset Tool, Communicator Mindset Tool, Lazy Tester's Mindset Tool, Analytical Mindset Tool, Bug Finder Mindset Tool, Curiosity Mindset Tool, “Bug Conviction” Mindset Tool, “Business” Mindset Tool etc

Key Takeaways
  * “Mindset Tools"" is an extract from real life test experiences hence it can bring about awareness, learning and development.

  * The idea of using the ""Mindset Tools"" to develop a tester's mindset can help to introduce a level of flexibility that is essential for effectiveness in our reasoning about our daily test task and challenges.

  * Because the “Mindset Tools"" is a breakdown from real life test stories, we can adapt the reasoning to real life test experiences.

  * The idea of using the “Mindset Tools"" to develop a tester's mindset can sensitize our common sense to become aware and conscious of “Mindset Tools"" that can be very useful for our development but which we have unconsciously neglected.

  * Using the inventory of “Mindset Tools"" to develop a tester's mindset, we can easily and consciously recognize our growth and progressively become better at testing, regardless of our experience.
