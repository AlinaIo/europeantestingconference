Quite a lot of testers often miss out on the mindset that’s needed for testing and delivery of quality products. Sometimes it seems that quality consciousness is missing. Little wonder why some testers only find obvious bugs and why quality is far-fetched from the Program under test (PUT), despite the presence of testers on the project. Adding up to this is the overwhelming and unnecessary challenges that await a project where individuals in each role (programmer, project manager, test lead, testers) lack proper understanding and appropriation of the level of “tester’s mindset” that is needed for each role, in order to enhance successful delivery of quality products.

In this presentation I will present to you a set of tools that has helped me during my personal journey as a tester.

I started out as a tester who knew little or nothing about testing. While I reflected on my daily task and how to keep growing, I discovered that different task, required different lenses, viewed at different angles, with different mindsets hence to effectively test I need to tweak my mindset for different task. To achieve this, I need to keep my mindset flexible when I test. To keep my mindset flexible and help me look at things from different angles, I put a label on the mindset approaches that I find useful and I call each labeled mindset a ”Mindset Tool”. Over time, my way of reasoning evolved into a set of “Mindset Tools” that I refer to as “My Mindset Toolkit”. These tools have helped me grow in my reasoning about the challenges I’m faced with on my daily task.

I will talk about how my "Mindset Toolkit" has helped me grow from a tester that finds obvious bugs to a tester that finds important bugs. I will give examples of different mindset tools, how I came up with them and how I have used them to become a better tester and better team member in Software development projects. I will approach mindset tools with focus on testers, test leads, programmers and project managers, bringing to light the need for a tester’s mindset for each role on the project and describing mindset tools that are beneficial for each of these roles. I will further propose a model that can help individuals develop their own mindset tools depending on the type of environment and product being developed.

A few of these Mindset Tools are: User Mindset Tool, “Already Tested” Mindset Tool, Curiosity Mindset Tool, Analytical Mindset Tool, Lazy Tester's Mindset Tool, Communicator Mindset Tool, “Bug Conviction “Mindset Tool, Trust Mindset Tool, “Embarrassment handling” Mindset Tool, Confidence Mindset Tool,  Courage Mindset Tool, “Business” Mindset Tool, “Team leading” Mindset Tool, “Dog Style” Mindset Tool, “Cat Style Mindset Tool.

Key takeaways of my presentation:

  * “My Mindset toolkit” talk is unique and beneficial to every role on the project: Programmers, Testers, Test leads and Project managers because there’s a level of tester’s mindset that’s needed in each role in order to enhance successful delivery of a quality product.
  * “Mindset Tools" are extracted from real life test experiences hence it can bring about awareness, learning and development.
  * The idea of using the "Mindset Tools" to develop a tester's mindset can help to introduce a level of flexibility that is essential for effectiveness in our reasoning about our daily test task and challenges.
  * Because the “Mindset Tools" is a breakdown from real life test stories, we can adapt the reasoning to real life test experiences.
  * The idea of using the “Mindset Tools" to develop a tester's mindset can sensitize our common sense to become aware and conscious of “Mindset Tools" that can be very useful for our development but which we have unconsciously neglected.
  * Using the inventory of “Mindset Tools" to develop a tester's mindset, we can easily and consciously recognize our growth and progressively become better at testing, regardless of our experience.
  * The “My Mindset Toolkit” talk proposes a way to improve expertise in testing and collaboration in Software development teams.
