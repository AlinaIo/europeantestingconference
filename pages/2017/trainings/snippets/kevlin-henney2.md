Although a great deal of the enthusiasm for agile development initially grew from software developers, much of the current focus in agile circles has moved to organisational aspects, product management and soft skills. Craftsmanship has long been a quality and a metaphor applied to software development, but more recently software craftsmanship has emerged as a more explicit movement and branding focused on reclaiming and re-emphasising the importance of the detail, of how to code and how to do it well.

This training explores the key elements of software craftsmanship, from what constitutes good code and unit tests to deliberate practice and reflection.

There will be slides, there will be discussion, there will be code â€” and there will be fun! The hands-on sessions will follow a coding dojo format with a focus on pair programming and TDD. No special software is needed, just Wi-Fi access, as we will be using the online cyber-dojo environment.
