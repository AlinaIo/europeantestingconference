<i> This training is half-a-day and paired with the Security training under the theme of the core parafunctional quality aspects</i>

Every piece of software with an interface has one thing in common, people. And where people are involved there will always be hidden gaps in usability we are blind to. One of the most effective ways to uncover these issues is through usability testing.

Anyone can facilitate a usability test, but there are some important techniques you must learn to ensure you receive unbiased results. In this hands on training we will practice planning and conducting usability tests. During our time together we will:

   * Craft scenarios and tasks that donâ€™t lead users

   * Conduct usability tests

   * Learn when and how to dig in deeper with candidates

   * Discover why it's important to let a user struggle during the session

   * Learn methods to gather valuable feedback from teammates who are observing

This training will focus on applied practice, and we will learn these things by doing them. Attendees are encouraged to bring a product they would like to test to the workshop.
