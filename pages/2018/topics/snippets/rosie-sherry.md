There is one consistent thing that drives me forward with my work - the need to help positively change the software testing industry.  Ask me how we can do this, and I’ll say more testers need to up their marketing skills.

In this talk, I will release my years of frustration at the lack of marketing know how that our community holds and why it is so important for us to learn some of these skills.  I will take you along the journey that I’ve been through and I will explain how we can take relatively easy steps towards making a big difference.
