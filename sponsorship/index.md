###Sponsorship

[European Testing Conference 2016](www.europeantestingconference.eu) is looking for sponsors at an event aiming to bring together over 200 participants to learn and share on testing, energize themselves and to break out of their comfort zones. It’s a great sponsoring opportunity to get in touch with enthusiastic quality-oriented software professionals.

### Concept
Testing is important. This conference is about getting experts and practitioners together to talk, learn and practice the art of testing. We’re looking into advanced new methods into making our testing more effective, as well as enrich our understanding of fundamental methods to grow a stronger community.

### Audience
Our audience is testers, developers, analysts and managers. We’re bringing down the divide in testing. We travel around Europe, starting with Bucharest in 2016.
